# Polling people

Which factors to consider when polling people, which questions to ask, and how to interpret the results:

1. Ask some open-ended questions. This will allow people to express their opinions in their own words, rather than being limited to a set of pre-determined answers.
2. Ask questions about specific applications of AI. This will help people to think about the technology in a more concrete way, rather than just in general terms.
3. Ask questions about the future. This will help people to think about the technology in a more abstract way, rather than just in specific terms.
4. Ask questions about current applications of AI. This will help people to think about the technology in a more "today and now" way rather then trying to imagine. This will help us to undersgtand what is the current knowledge of people about the current state of AI development.
