# Attitudes of different people to the development of AI, their conserns and fears

## Some main statements

1. AI has the potential to transform our world and improve our lives in countless ways, but it also raises concerns about job displacement, privacy, and safety.

2. Different groups of people have varying attitudes towards AI. Some people are excited about the possibilities of AI and are eager to embrace it, while others are skeptical or fearful of its impact.

3. Age, education, and cultural background are all factors that can influence attitudes towards AI. For example, younger people and those with more education tend to be more optimistic about AI, while older people and those with less education may be more wary.

4. People's attitudes towards AI can also be shaped by their personal experiences with the technology. Those who have had positive experiences with AI are more likely to view it favorably, while those who have had negative experiences may be more skeptical.

5. Trust in AI is a crucial factor in its adoption and acceptance. People are more likely to embrace AI if they trust that it will act in their best interests and make decisions fairly and ethically.

6. The level of transparency and explainability of AI systems is also important in shaping attitudes towards the technology. People may be more hesitant to use AI if they cannot understand how it works or why it makes certain decisions.

7. The media plays a significant role in shaping public perceptions of AI. News articles, movies, and TV shows can all influence how people perceive AI and its potential impact on society. Media must be regulated to prevent the spread of misinformation and to ensure that AI is portrayed in a realistic way.

8. Some people have concerns about the ethical implications of AI, particularly in areas like surveillance, facial recognition, and autonomous weapons. These concerns may shape their attitudes towards the technology and influence their willingness to support its development.

9. Accessebility of AI is also important. No party should be allowed to monopolize AI. AI should be accessible to everyone who has internet access or to noone at all (second option in probably not possible).

10. Finally, it's important to consider the potential economic and social impacts of AI. While AI has the potential to create new jobs and industries, it may also lead to job displacement and widening income inequality. Understanding these potential impacts is important when considering attitudes towards AI.

## Polling people

Which factors to consider when polling people, which questions to ask, and how to interpret the results:

1. Ask some open-ended questions. This will allow people to express their opinions in their own words, rather than being limited to a set of pre-determined answers.
2. Ask questions about specific applications of AI. This will help people to think about the technology in a more concrete way, rather than just in general terms.
3. Ask questions about the future. This will help people to think about the technology in a more abstract way, rather than just in specific terms.
4. Ask questions about current applications of AI. This will help people to think about the technology in a more "today and now" way rather then trying to imagine. This will help us to undersgtand what is the current knowledge of people about the current state of AI development.
